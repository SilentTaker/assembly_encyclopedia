# Assembly Encyclopedia

This will be a database, for each assembly manual, containing the current 
(current to the ones I located) op codes for the respective chipsets. Yes, I
have seen other Op Code repo's, but they do not have what I am looking for. I
have manuals in an other repo, I'll move them over here once I start getting
the needed information.

## WARNINGS

Since this is going to be chipset based Op Codes, they will have their own
directory, with files regarding different topics. From memory layout to
warnings regarding how the bits are handled by the CPU. Both developer manuals
that I have found are well over 3,000 pages so they'll be here for reference as
I go through and pull out the things I need for another project. I'll add PNG's
for whatever they have printed.
